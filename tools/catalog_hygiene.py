"""
Catalog-hygiene tools — Epic 9 (Stories 9.1-9.7).

Wave 0 (this file at story-open): empty `register()` skeleton + the convention
contract below. Each Wave 1/2 story plugs its tool function into `register()`
without touching shopify_mcp.py again.

Write-tool convention — `confirm`, not `dryRun`:
    Trello card ualcSqFq pre-start gate: the spec's `dryRun: boolean` wording is
    NOT followed here. All write tools in this module use
    `confirm: bool = False` to match the existing 22-tool codebase convention
    (see tools/products.py:303 for the canonical template). Same semantics —
    `confirm=False` returns a preview, `confirm=True` executes — just the
    name the rest of the codebase already uses.
