# Shopify MCP Server

A custom Python [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects Claude directly to a Shopify store via the Admin REST API. Built for the **All or Nothing Cypher** drop store under the **Global Streetwear Syndicate** parent brand.

Enables Claude to read products, check inventory, manage collections, handle discounts, and review orders — all through natural language chat in Claude Desktop.

## Safety design

- All **write operations** return a preview and require `confirm=True` before any data is changed
- **URL handles** are never modified unless `change_handle=True` is explicitly passed
- Every write operation is logged to `aon_mcp_log.txt` with timestamp, tool name, and change detail
- Product titles are validated against AON/Vanish naming conventions after every update

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A Shopify store with a [Custom App](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) and Admin API access token
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopify-mcp.git
cd shopify-mcp
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure credentials

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-01
```

### 5. Create the Shopify Custom App

In your Shopify Admin → **Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps**:

1. Create a new app
2. Under **Configuration**, enable these Admin API access scopes:

```
read_products
write_products
read_inventory
write_inventory
read_orders
read_price_rules
write_price_rules
read_discounts
write_discounts
write_publications
```

3. Install the app and copy the **Admin API access token** into your `.env`

### 6. Test the connection

```bash
python3 test_shopify_mcp.py
```

Expected output:
```
Testing Shopify API connection...
  Connected to: Your Store Name (your-store.myshopify.com)
  Plan: basic
  Currency: USD

Connection test PASSED.
```

### 7. Register with Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shopify-aon": {
      "command": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/shopify-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/shopify-mcp/shopify_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "SHOPIFY_STORE_URL": "your-store.myshopify.com",
        "SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN": "shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "SHOPIFY_API_VERSION": "2024-01"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your macOS username (`whoami` in Terminal).

Restart Claude Desktop. The Shopify tools will appear in the tools panel.
