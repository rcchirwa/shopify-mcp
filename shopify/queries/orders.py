"""GraphQL query strings for the ``orders`` domain.

The bottom layer of the ``orders`` migration (Story 10.29 / A5, following the
products pilot in Story 10.23 and the catalog_hygiene / collections / discounts /
inventory migrations). Pure strings — no imports from ``shopify.operations`` or
``tools``. ``orders`` is a read-only domain: two reads, no mutations.

**A shared fragment applies.** The two reads — ``GET_ORDERS`` (list) and
``GET_ORDER_BY_ID`` (single) — select the same order-node core
(``id name createdAt totalPriceSet { shopMoney { amount } }``) verbatim, so it is
factored into the ``OrderCoreFields`` fragment both queries spread (Story 10.29 /
A5, AC3). Each read still adds its own fields inline — the list read adds the
``referringSite``/``landingSite`` traffic pair and a fixed ``lineItems(first: 50)``
summary (with ``pageInfo.hasNextPage`` so the per-order cap is detected and warned,
not silently dropped — Story 10.34 / A3); the single read adds the
financial/fulfillment status, ``referringSite``, and a paginated ``lineItems`` with
unit prices. Centralizing only the shared core
(which includes the version-sensitive ``totalPriceSet`` money shape) means the
next Admin-API money-shape change is a one-line edit instead of two.
"""

# Shared core selection on an Order: identity + creation date + total money.
# `totalPriceSet { shopMoney { amount } }` is the version-sensitive bit (the
# 2024-07+ Money shape), so centralizing it keeps the next shape change to a
# single edit; both reads extract the amount via the same null-tolerant chain.

# NOTE: orders.nodes.lineItems is a connection nested inside a list connection
# (orders is itself paginated). client.paginate() walks a single top-level
# connection and cannot paginate a nested connection, so the per-order line items
# stay capped at the fixed first: 50 below — full pagination of this nested-in-list
# connection remains out of scope. We DO select pageInfo { hasNextPage } so the cap
# is detected, not silent: get_orders emits a per-order at-cap WARNING when an order
# is truncated (parity with the single-order get_order path; Story 10.34 / A3 —
# warn-on-cap, mirroring T-9.5-variants-cap / Story 10.12-media-cap).
